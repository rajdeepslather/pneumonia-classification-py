This paper will demonstrate how a model based on a deep convolutional neural network can be used to detect pneumonia in X-Ray images of lungs. We will show the results from various architectures, including in-house, Alexnet, and ResNet. For our best model, we will ensure to check for the best parameters to most efficiently train our model and demonstrate the use of transfer learning for the ResNet architecture. Finally, we will compare our results against a Kaggle competition.
